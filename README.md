  The customer for Gaming Room wanted to develop an application that would include a web application that would let teams enter their responses based on what they observed. The Gaming Room client, which was first available on Android, aimed to become a web application so that more people could use it. The client intended to model the app after the game from the 1980s: Win, Lose, or Draw. Additionally, the client wanted to do this inside their budget.  I believe I did a very good job of comprehending and communicating the client's desires for their game, particularly the key specifications.  It was really beneficial, in my opinion, to comprehend the client's primary needs when writing the code.  Giving me a straightforward list makes it easier for me to comprehend what I'm working with.  Even though I believe that almost all of my work needs extensive editing, I believe that knowing the benefits and drawbacks of designing for operating platforms is the one aspect that really sticks out.  This, in my opinion, is crucial to comprehending what you need to be on the lookout for and what factors need to be taken into account. 
  
  I see the user's requirement as something I should be aware of at all times.  I have to keep asking myself how my design would be received by the user.  It basically involves adopting the user's mindset because the goal is lost if I ignore their demands.  I have to think about the audience when I develop a project, not just myself.  It will draw less traffic and cost the customer money to maintain the website if it is too difficult for users to utilize. The first thing I want to consider while building software is how to optimize the project's memory and storage.  Making software that uses a lot of external resources might lead to a number of issues.  Writing up pseudocode first would probably be one tactic I would employ to better understand my plans and thought process so that I could produce something akin to it.  Debugging the project and executing unit tests are also crucial prerequisites.
